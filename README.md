## About Me
Hi there! My name is Julia Terry, I was born and raised in Chicago, IL but currently live in Orlando, FL and work at Walt Disney World. As a true Chicagoan, I love hot dogs, italian beef sandiwiches (dipped with hot peppers, obvioulsy), and Fall Out Boy. I have been a Cast Member for a little over seven years now and I absolutely adore my job. In my free time I enjoy napping, shopping, spending time with friends, and hyper-focussing on whatever new hobby I've decided to pick up. And if that doesn't properly sum up who I am, the gif above might do the trick.
## Past Coding Experience
While I truly don't have any notable coding experience, I have been interested in learning how to code since 8th grade when Tumblr was the "it" social media platform. Similar to MySpace, Tumblr had a large emphasis on having unique personal profiles. These profiles acted similar to your own website, where you would "reblog" photos, gifs, quotes, art, etc. that usually followed a strict theme. These profiles were customizable using "layouts" and you would copy and past the code of the layout into the sidebar of the page to change the setup of your site. I quickly became obsessed with learning how to tweak these layouts to make them exactly as I desired. I would go into the code and change the color, font, spacing, external link page names, you name it. I was the only person in my friend group who was able to figure out how to do this and therefore everyone would come to me to request their custom made layouts. How I learned to do this solely by looking at the code and figuring out how to tweak it at the age of 12 is beyond me, but that was the first and last of my coding experiences. I am hoping that that ease of knowledge helps me in my journey to learn Web Development, but worst case scenario I can still make a really cool Tumblr layout.
## Career Goals
1. Continue with my Master's Degree and utilize my concentration and electives to narrow down potential career paths
2. Network with friends and/or people I meet through my current job to gain knowledge of career opportunities
3. My dream goal would be to find a job working for Google, so long as it presents a similar or better opportunity than the job I currently have
